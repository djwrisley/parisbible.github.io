## Welcome to the Paris Bible Project!

The Paris Bible Project aims to understand the production and diffusion of medieval Latin Bibles in Europe.

A Paris Bible, also known as a Parisian Bible, is a format of Bible that is standardized in the 13th century and spreads as a model through Europe. It was started by Estelle Guéville (Louvre Abu Dhabi) and David Joseph Wrisley (NYU Abu Dhabi).
